               <p>DreamTeam was designed for the University of Waterloo Ultimate Frisbee team, to  provide the coaches and captains with a way to track athleteâ€™s performance and development in a tryout setting.
               When a team is hosting tryouts, coaches and captains need to evaluate various athletes and later access that information to build a strong and balanced team. </p>
               <br/>
               <p> DreamTeam is here to help!</p>
